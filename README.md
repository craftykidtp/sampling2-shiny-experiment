# Sampling–2: Experimental Design using R Shiny

This R Shiny application demonstrates sample size determination for estimating a population mean using stratified sampling.

### Features
- Multiple subgroups (strata)
- Incorporates variance (sampling bias), cost, and time
- Optimal sample size allocation
- Interactive experimental design plots

### Concepts Used
- Sampling–2
- Stratified sampling
- Cost–bias tradeoff
- Experimental design visualization

Developed as part of Statistics and Data Science coursework.
